HIII AVRIEL THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELPPPP!!!!! (he helped me figure out the readme while we were screen sharing so i wrote that and I dont want to delete it)


- I imitated the dedign of my favorite surf magazine, the surfers journal

- I feel there may be too many classes or unnecessary ID's. I don't think my code is so clean but I do know it's overexplanitory and organized with commented out sections.

- the background photo is an image i took while hiking on the northern coast of california

- I put in hover features on all the nav elements and they stay once you hover over them, but to navigate away from them simply click any where on the body

- once you click my name, a modal with the most important question of our generation appears

- on the contact me buttons I have added a hover affect for my email because I wanted it to look more uniform. I hate the mail app on mac and was looking for ways to circumvent this but was unsuccessful. 

- I wish i could have put my resume in an iframe tag but i couldn't figure out properly the google permission. https://docs.google.com/document/d/13N958T8UXEXtB_1XbdLc1X7v9b6PASXogfGwIueaN-s/edit?usp=sharing

- My css is not fully responsive, sometimes while using css I wanted to put my head through a glass door but all is well now because I'm excited to just have built something decent.

- my biggest accomplishment in this project is the self confidence I gained. I feel I really proved to myself that I am not as ditsy or incapable as I feel and I'm excited to lose all this confidence once we progress in the curriculum but then I can't wait to gain it all back again.
